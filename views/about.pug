            | My natural ability to learn coding technologies and ingenuity to solve complex problems
            | is best displayed by the Pearson Text of English Preparation project. When I started this project
            | I had never coded before nor had any knowledge of coding. I quickly learned the required technologies
            | as I developed this project. I single handedly designed and developed the front end and back end for
            | nearly 200 dynamic pages and wrote over a 1000 questions and model answers. The SEO focused development
            | led the website to being on 1st page for many keywords in key markets within a year. I did this
            | working 8 months over a span of 1 year.
          p I am looking to work with an employer to develop my skills further in utilizing and exploring the potential of
            | technology and process to most efficiently meet customer needs.
